        To upgrade to a paid Service Plan you will be required to add your credit card details to your account. After you have done so, the contract can only be terminated in accordance with the provisions of Point 3 below.

        * **1.3** You are solely accountable to Billions & Billions for your Account and for any actions carried out using your Account. In this regard, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Billions & Billions from any and all claims, demands or damages that might result from any actions carried out using your Account. It is therefore your responsibility to keep your user name and password secret at all times and to not divulge details thereof to any third party. You can, however, set up additional users for your Account. In the event that you should set up additional users for your Account, you will be liable for all and any actions carried out by these additional users to the same extent as for your personal user. You agree to notify Billions & Billions immediately of any improper or inadmissible use of your Account or should you have reason to assume or believe that your password is no longer secret. In such cases, Billions & Billions reserves the right to temporarily deny access to your Account until the matter has been resolved. Billions & Billions also reserves the right to request a password change and temporarily deny access to an Account should it determine that there are reasonable grounds to assume said Account might be being used by an unauthorized person or persons.

        * **1.4** You can change to a different Service Plan at any time using the relevant function in the Service. It should, however, be noted that any downgrade of your Service Plan may lead to a loss of data, functionality and/or storage capacity.

        * **1.5** Billions & Billions reserves the right to alter the services included in the individual Service Plans or to add or remove specific functions. Billions & Billions undertakes to publish details of any major changes to the scope of the Service on the Upsite website (www.upsite.io, hereinafter referred to as the “Website”). In the event that such changes would significantly reduce the scope of the Service, or key functionality be removed, you will be given an option to terminate your contract in accordance with Point 3 of these Terms and Conditions. If no notification of termination is received prior to the next billing date, Billions & Billions will assume you have accepted and are in agreement with the changes.

        * **1.6** Billions & Billions reserves the right to discontinue the Service in its entirety. Notification of such discontinuation will be published in a timely manner on the Website.
