- image widget / upload

      research paperclip, carrierwave
      see backbone book - attachments

      create a new image model
      add a new icon to the hud
      create a new form dialog

      in the new image form view

      on saving the form...

      create a new attachment model



      who should handle the upload?

      the image model?













      upload the image on save

      submit the file with FormData
      monitor the progress with xhr.upload

      save file to local file system in development
      upload to s3 in production

      when uploaded...
        save the image to the database
        data.url = upload.url

      resize to 300x300


      own route for uploads!
        /attachments
        /uploads
        return json url?

      see basecamp/github api

      general approach
          read file from form
          create new filedata object
          manually submit it to /attachments
          wait for response with URL
          create image model with nested attachments object


- cleanup attachments controller
- theming (colors + font)
- make header editable (own widget class, deletable:false)
- validations
- user view composition for dialog/forms?
- jbuilder
- use jquery_ujs + remove bb authtoken adapter
- garbage collection
