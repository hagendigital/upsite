TODO:

Image widget / upload:

  - Handle delete widget > delete attachment (+ file)











- remove /texts + images/ routes
- theming (colors + font)
- make header editable (own widget class, deletable:false)
- validations
- jbuilder for attachment json
- use view composition for dialog/forms?
- garbage collection (use listenTo, track sub views)


✔ customize file path ( site.id/hash_preset.ext) @done (13-01-27 20:28)
✔ save file to local file system in development, upload to s3 in production @done (13-01-27 20:27)
✔ create Image + Text model instances, not generic Widget (are subclasses needed?) @done (13-01-27 17:13)
