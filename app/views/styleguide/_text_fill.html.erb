<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Resources</h2><h3>Research Report</h3><p>The Sonic Pi: Live &amp; Coding Research Report has been written and compiled by Dr Pam Burnard, Principal Researcher, University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education - Sonic Pi: Live &amp; Coding's Research Partner.&nbsp; The report includes key findings, case studies and evidence to demonstrate how Sonic Pi transforms music education.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/research_report_dc_02.pdf">Click here to download the full report</a></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Assessing music coded using Sonic Pi</h3><p>As a result of the research we identified that teachers were looking for some guidance on how to assess music coded using Sonic Pi, both compositions and live coded performances.&nbsp; <span>In this section, we identify several approaches to assessment developed by Pam Burnard and Louis Major (Faculty of Education â€“ University of Cambridge). These encourage practitioners (teachers/artists/technologists) and pupils to work together to develop assessment practices that take the form of joint evaluations. </span></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Assessing-music-coded-using-Sonic-Pi.pdf">Click here to access guidance on assessment</a></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Sonic Pi:&nbsp; the program</h3><p>Dr Sam Aaron has been working closely with teachers, ICT technicians, project artists and pupils throughout Sonic Pi: Live &amp; Coding to develop the Sonic Pi program in response to user needs and abilities.&nbsp; Sonic Pi&nbsp; has evolved during the project from a compositional tool for digital music making into an instrument that can be played live (Sonic Pi v2.0).&nbsp;</p><p>Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://sonic-pi.net/">sonic-pi.net</a> to download the latest version of the program for Raspberry Pi or Mac and access examples to get you started.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Lesson Plans and Scheme of Work</h3><p>As a result of six week trials in two classes across two schools, close consultation with music teachers and Digital Music Education specialist Tim Hallas, Ross Wilson (Instrumental Music Teacher, Cambridgeshire Music) has developed a Scheme of Work (11 x 1 hour lessons) to support the Key Stage 3 Music Curriculum.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Scheme-of-Work.docx">Scheme of work</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-1.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 1</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-2.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 2</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-3.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 3</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-4.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 4</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-5.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 5</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-6.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 6</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-7.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 7</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-8.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 8</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-9.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 9</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-10.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 10</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Sonic-Pi-Lesson-Plans-Week-11.docx">Lesson Plans - Week 11</a></p><p>A version of these teaching resources to be released on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/">Raspberry Pi </a>website (by end November 2014)</p><p>Click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/teachers-classroom-guide/">here</a> for notes on set up and use of the Raspberry Pi computer in the classroom.</p><p>Click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-lesson/">here</a> for an extra lesson plan to teach students what a Raspberry Pi is and how to use it.</p><p>If you're a teacher and want to learn more about ways to use Raspberry Pi in school click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy-3-report/">here</a> to find out about Picademy.</p><p><a href="/s/Sonic_Pi_code_for_Get_Lucky_by_Daft_Punk.txt">Download Sonic Pi code for a version of Get Lucky by Daft Punk</a> - a good example of how to use Sonic Pi to make an arrangement of an existing song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Summer School: plan, guide and additional resources</h3><p>The delivery element of Sonic Pi: Live &amp; Coding culminated in a five day Summer School hosted by Cambridge Junction at the end of July 2014 for 10-14 year olds.&nbsp; This was billed as an 'amazing five day adventure in live coding' and attracted 60 young people from the Cambridge area ranging in ability, prior knowledge and interest.&nbsp;</p><p>The key components of the Summer School were:</p><ul><li>Getting to grips with Sonic Pi as a tool for composing and performing music</li><li>Discovering what live coding can be via a series of live coding performances from guest live coders</li><li>Getting a taste of live coding performance via a Live Coding Battle</li><li>Building performance skills via a conducted performance of soundscape compositions</li><li>Building music coding and performance skills towards a final group / individual showcase performance</li></ul><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Juneau-Projects-Summer-School-Plan.docx">Download the full plan, including notes on delivery and technical requirements.</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="/s/Summer-School-Guide.doc">Download introductory notes and guidance to help you run a live coding summer school in an arts venue.</a></p><p><a href="/s/Sonic_Pi_code_for_Get_Lucky_by_Daft_Punk.txt">Download Sonic Pi code for a version of Get Lucky by Daft Punk</a> - an example mentioned in the Summer School guide.</p><p><a href="/s/An_Introduction_to_Sonic_Pi.ppt">Download An Introduction to Sonic Pi</a> - a Powerpoint presentation used in the Summer School.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuwvvSKQ-BBR7Io_PJXeT-8ioV9BKez6B">External link to a Youtube playlist</a> of live coding performances.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>How to make your own Sonic Pi Controller</h3><p>Sonic Pi: Live &amp; Coding Lead Artists, Juneau Projects injected an exciting dimension to the project, especially in terms of exploring ideas for performance with Sonic Pi.&nbsp; Big, bright buttons 'that do stuff to and with the code in Sonic Pi' and interesting looking controllers became a feature of this project.&nbsp; In this part of the Toolkit Juneau Projects share some of their ideas, offer links to other inspiring artist projects and give you the code to get going with making your own run / stop and function controllers.</p>
