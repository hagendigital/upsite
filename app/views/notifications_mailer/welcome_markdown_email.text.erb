Hi there,

Welcome, and thanks for trying Upsite.

Your site:
<%= @site_url %>

While markdown is great, it's not for everyone. Under Settings > Experiments you can turn off markdown mode, enabling more user-friendly features such as image resizing and drag and drop.

Check out the guide to help you get started:
<%= @site_url %>help/start

Get an early look at the features coming soon to Upsite.

If there's anything I can help you with just hit reply and let me know.

Bill from Upsite
