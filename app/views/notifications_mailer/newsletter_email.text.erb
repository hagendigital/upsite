Hi there,

Upsite is shutting down on 1 June 2017.

It's been really fun working on Upsite, but due to lack of time and funding
it's become necessary to discontinue the service.

If you had an active Pro subscription your payment has already been refunded.

If you'd like a backup of your site that you can host elsewhere just reply
before June 1st and let me know.

Thanks for using Upsite, I hope you found it useful.

- William at Upsite
