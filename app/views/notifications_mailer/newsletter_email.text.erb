Hi there,

A little while ago you signed up for Upsite - the simplest way to
create a one-page website. We wanted to let you know about some changes
we're making in order to keep the service sustainable and spam-free.

Upsite is now invite-only. As an existing member you can log in as usual,
but you can now also invite people to join (see the Settings > Invites tab).

We also recently introduced our "Pro" plan, which for about $1 a month
let's you create up to 10 sites. See the Settings > Account tab for details.

Your site can be found at:
http://<%= @site.subdomain %>.upsite.io

Thanks for your continued support,

- Team Upsite
