Usability testing:

- Do people understand how to sign up/ make a site?
- Is it clear that the homepage are websites people have made?
- Once signed up, is it clear how to build the site (are the icons and next steps clear?)
- Is it clear that once you create a block, your website it is already online?
- Is it clear that you can only delete and not edit the blocks?
- Is it clear that it's for free and there's no credit card needed?
- Do people understand what the ads are? and is it likely that they click on them?
- Are any of this a real issue that people have on their experience with upsite?


Feedback:

* more characters in the text field would be appreciated

* zoom/full size for images

* would be helpful to be able to add a title/text heading and footer to each of the boxes if you wished to

*  i think it would be great to be able to customize the header / logo for small companies and porfolio sites.

* Do upsite pages get to be seen via a google search?  I cannot find my wonderer site when just using search.

* Once a box is posted, is there any way to edit it?

* The box for text is limited to 600 words which is not great for a blog.  maybe you didnt plan for it to be used as a blog?

* The text box that invites you to add a link doesn't seem to work properly. I added a link but it only showed the link on the page.

Usability feedback from Maite:

Most people said It was easy to use. And easy to understand.
I can add myself that my vimeo links appeared broken and just black squares for a while last week.

* User 1:
  - Didn't watch the tutorial. started watching other people pages.
  - Wasn't sure who could see her webpage, if it was a beta only for ourselves or if it was already online.
  - wasn't able to to edit an uploaded text.
  - very easy to use and friendly
  - didn't know how to delete the page.

* User 2:
  - In Firefox text appeared like cut in half. he send me a pic but its no longer in my whatsapp history, sorry. his user and password appeared broken.
  - He also send me this link because someone offered him this service for portfolio pages. https://fabrik.io  

* User 3: love the design
  - seems to have a pro designers target public. like thereÂ´s nothing at the beginning that explains to you how its used.
  - like there's no introduction.
  - too generic and non specific for catching someone who's looking to make a "restaurant webpage".what the person means that maybe people search for specific uses.

* User 4: Easy to use,
  - watched the tutorial and thought it was very well explained.
  - as myself he didn't understood when the page was uploaded. that about the first block.
  - As user 1 didn't know how to edit texts already uploaded.

Most of them really liked the explanation after they tried it, what I mean is that, as well as what happened with me,  when I tell people that the page is to supposed to be really minimalist and easy to use, that is supposed to be depurated of options and templates and decisions everybody thinks its a great idea, but the great challenge today is to find a way for people to see that right away. Maybe with an intro, maybe with a slogan, maybe with a video, maybe in a few pic, maybe we must work on that.


Testing services:

* https://www.usertesting.com/ seems to be like the biggest company there is.  It can give you results in just one hour but the price is way too high,  49 per video. And it's just the users videos and audio using the site.

* http://www.trymyui.com/ this one is cheaper, 35 per test or discount prices for a bulk. With this one you still don't get any conclusions just the videos and comments of the users. there is one free test that maybe we can check out.

* https://meet.userzoom.es/remote-usability-testing-download-starter-kit-id609 this one seems different than the rest. I couldn't get the price but it says you can have 2 free tests. This one gives you more than just the video, like graphs and analysis but it seems you have to download a software or something. I really didn't understand it very well.

* https://www.fiverr.com/categories/programming-tech/user-testing-services/#layout=auto&page=1  This site is very interesting.  It's not like any of the other sites, Is more like a testers database, you have the users, their rankings, how much it takes for them to answer, what they do for a living, their level of expertise, and most of them charge only 5 dollars for a regular test!!! You can narrow your sample and choose tester by age, gender, country, language, etc.  Some of them are designers or programmers and can charge you more for a more thorough test. But the price range is much much cheaper than the rest.
